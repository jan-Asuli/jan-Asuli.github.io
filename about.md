Hi! my name is Ashley and I'm an amateur philosopher, programmer & poet. I'm hoarding all the words that start with p, and so naturally I also go by Pearl or Pearls. Ollie/Olivia works too! I go by any of the he/she/they pronouns, as well as the neopronouns moo and shroom.  

Also, my website name is in Toki Pona! it means "person Asuli", which is the way to denote that my name is Ashley in that conlang. isnt that fun?
