title: Moonlit Stones
---

moonlit stones beneath our feet,\
they know more souls than we can meet.\
we run round free below the stars\
and claim this world we know is ours.

and in a field we find a great climbing tree,\
just big enough for you, you, and me\
we take this throne, gaze across the land\
our hopes and hearts just must expand.

that chilly breeze cuts past the grass,\
and pushes you over flat on your ass\
we smile and laugh and smile s'more\
exploding with joy like we hadn't before.

come, wade carefully into the lake,\
stare at yourself as the image shakes\
the water creeps up to our waists\
and we splash around with no great haste

already sun is rising, now its dawn\
stare at those colours, do naught but fawn.\
we've shared these pleasures through the night\
now to make best of the sun's great light!
