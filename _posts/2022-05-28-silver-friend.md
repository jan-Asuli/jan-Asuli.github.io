title: Poem - Silver Friend  
---

My silver friend,\
that insistent penetrator of loneliness.\
she pierces my heart\
with the light of the sun.

My silver friend,\
at once a queen and a soldier.\
she stands solitary and watches\
with a careful eye.

My silver friend,\
how dear you are to all\
close at once to everyone,\
whispering your love.

My silver friend,\
today you start to close your eyes.\
may you soon sleep well,\
as we have under your grace.
