encrusted in the darkness fly little jewels of flame,\
those majestic many-a-time born torches of fame.\
sometimes they play our little game called narrative\
and give to us stories perennial, masquerading eternal:

ever important beasts of the zodiac, some say they guide,\
a golden ram and heavenly bull, the dioscuri and a crab;\
the flooding-lion and demeter, the ever-just and a scorpion;\
the man-horse and water-goat, last ganymede amd the fish.

many hold these beings twelve in high regard regardless \
of the irrelevance of their place at the ecliptic;\
all the other stories of the stars hidden behind polluted skies\
out of sight, out of mind.

but these stories we see out in the heavens,\
all of which are as important as our own -\
by this, it is to say as far as we take them to be - \
have vast beauty to uncover and tell.

Those little jewels encrusted in the night sky\
care not if we tell their stories, not one iota\
yet it is undeniable that in their vast home beyond ours\
there is a story they tell that you want to hear.
